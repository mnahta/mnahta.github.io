Android Application to Detect Best Images in a Burst (Need to change)<br>

<br>

Summary<br>

<br>

We are going to create an Android application that efficiently uses the
parallel processing capabilities of an Android-based machine&#8217;s
GPU to rapidly perform parallel image analysis on a burst . <br>

<br>

Background<br>

<br>

We are interested in creating an application that can simplify and
accelerate the process of selecting the best image from a burst.
Specifically, a burst contains a large number of images and it is often
cumbersome to sift through all the images to find the best one. Our
application aims to detect the images with the highest rate of people
with eyes open and smiling. If none of the images completely match all
the parameters, then our application will create a composite image i.e.
stitching together an image - from the entire library of burst - where
everyone is smiling with their eyes open. <br>

<br>

A sequential version of the application has several bottlenecks: <br>

<br>

i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serial analysis and execution of each image in the
burst will be extremely slow as there is a large number of photographs
in burst.&nbsp; We aim to provide a near real-time solution to the
problem. <br>

ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sequentially analyzing each image for face and
eye detection will be extremely slow, and applying a serial vision
algorithm to all the images in the burst would take a long time and a
lot of processing power. <br>

iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating the composite image sequentially will be a bottleneck in the runtime of this application. <br>

iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly, a sequential version of the
whole application will not be able to benefit from the machine&#8217;s
GPU power and will also slow down the CPU as it will perform a lot of
tasks on the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Therefore, all the aforementioned aspects of the application can be
significantly improved from parallelism. We plan to use OpenCL
(Android&#8217;s version of CUDA) to exploit parallelism in the
multi-core chip. The benefits of a parallel application be better
understood using the following illustrations highlighting the
difference between the sequential and parallel versions. <br>

The Challenge <br>

<br>

The application is challenging in a number of ways: <br>

<br>

i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OpenCL is written in C/C++ whereas Android
applications are written in Java. As we plan to make our code highly
parallelizable to specific machines (fully exploiting our knowledge of
the chips), we will have to compile C++ OpenCL code in our Java code.<br>

ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a burst contains a large number of images,
there will be a high amount of memory accesses. This implies that a lot
will depend on making sure that the computation-to-communication ratio
is high. To ensure that the computation-to-communication ratio is high,
we will need to handle cache optimizations of image data well in order
to achieve maximum cache hits. <br>

iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Efficiently detecting facial features is a lot
more than simply sending different parts of the image to different
cores; we will have to make sure that distribution of work is even and
handle cases that require high computation with more processing power. <br>

iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stitching together an image will require a lot of
inter-communication between processes and more processing power, which
means that we will need to dynamically handle parallel processing of
the code based not only on the dataset (burst) but also on what the
algorithm is working on &#8211; eye detection, smile detection,
stitching, etc. <br>

v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the analysis of each image, our application
will perform numerous checks to see if the input meets some
requirements. A high number of &#8216;if&#8217; statements might cause
divergent control flow execution, which will need to be handled in way
that it does not affect accuracy at the cost of speedup. <br>

<br>

Platform Choice<br>

<br>

TO DO<br>

<br>

Stretch Goal<br>

<br>

As a layer on top of the application, we plan to add a parallel Machine
Learning program. Specifically, we aim to supply this program with a
large number of training bursts and run it in a highly efficient and
parallel way (parallelizing over the CPU and the GPU) to make our
application quickly recognize important features of an image such as
landscape/portrait, daylight/night, etc. This will then help to speed
the rest of the application. <br>
